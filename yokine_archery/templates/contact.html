          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            For nearly 40 years, Yokine Archery has provided a safe, fun and 
            relaxing environment for people of all ages to enjoy the wonderful sport of archery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past decade, the focus of the club has shifted to developing 
            youth archers as the next generation of state, national and world champions.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we continue to support social members, our training focus will 
            be on young archers (10-25) or adults who want to actively compete. 
            As the program takes only its first steps, Yokine Archery members already 
            comprise over 50% of the state youth team (recurve) and the club boasts 
            two each of both male and female recurve archers in Australia’s top ten. 
            Not bad for under 25s and one of Australia’s smallest clubs!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our club is unique in providing regular, high level training and 
            coaching. We have regular guest speakers in fields such as sport 
            physiotherapy, sport psychology, biomechanics, and nutrition. We conduct 
            not only coaching sessions, but physical fitness training and we organise 
            high level training and friendly competitions with our Asian partners.
          </p>
          
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Yokine Archery Club was formed on the 29th June 1975 from a meeting 
            at the Yokine Primary School.  An informal training group had previously 
            existed and Syd Alman suggested a club be formed.  Syd Alman was the 
            first President, Judy Pearson was the first Secretary, Moira Missen 
            the First Treasurer and Maurice Alman the first Field Captain.
          <p>
            It has moved location several times. In the beginning the club had 
            a storage shed close to where the primary School buildings are now 
            and shot South to North, then the premises were extended with a government 
            grant to allow for the purchase of a tin garage. This was moved short 
            distances a number of times and finally located on the south west side 
            of the primary school where a concrete pad was laid and the shed 
            enlarged to provide club rooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1979 the Nationals were held on a reserve in Yokine and practice 
            was carried out at Yokine Club grounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a brief period after the International Shooting Complex was built, 
            Yokine moved there to support the cost of the complex. This was less 
            than satisfactory for club members so it was then returned to the 
            Yokine Primary School.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early 1990's the Club house was moved closer to the west side
            of the school oval when the block of land (owned by the school) on 
            which it was located was intended to be sold. This did not eventuate 
            but the club house had already been moved. The club is now situated 
            in the middle of well grassed grounds with native trees, banksias and 
            tuarts surrounding it.  Electricity was connected at about this time.
